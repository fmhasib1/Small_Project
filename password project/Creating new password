A password generator is a software tool that creates random or customized passwords for users. 
It helps users create stronger passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access.
These programs produce complex/strong passwords with combinations of numbers,
uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters such as braces, asterisks, slashes, etc.
