A password generator is a software tool that creates random or customized passwords for users. 
It helps users create stronger passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access.
These programs produce complex/strong passwords with combinations of numbers,
uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters such as braces, asterisks, slashes, etc.
There are tools for generating pronounceable passwords, as well as custom tools that allow users to set detailed criteria. 
For instance, a user could set a request for a certain number of characters, a certain mix of letters and numbers, 
a certain number of special characters, or any other criteria for generating a new password.
